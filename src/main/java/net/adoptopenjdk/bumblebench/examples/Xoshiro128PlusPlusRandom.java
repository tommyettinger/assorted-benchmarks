/**
 * A random number generator that is optimized for performance on 32-bit machines and with Google Web Toolkit, this uses
 * no multiplication and is identical to the published xoshiro128++ algorithm when generating {@code int} values. When
 * generating {@code long} values, it is a little different.
 * <br>
 * The actual speed of this is going to vary wildly depending on the platform being benchmarked.
 * Xoshiro128PlusPlusRandom has a guaranteed period of {@code pow(2, 128) - 1}.
 * <br>
 * This implements all optional methods in EnhancedRandom except {@link #skip(long)} or {@link #previousLong()}.
 * <br>
 * Based on <a href="https://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro128plusplus.c">this public-domain code</a> by Vigna and Blackman.
